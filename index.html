        1. To make a curry paste, blend together the 3 red finger chillies,<br>
        1/2 of the ground coriander, the cumin, turmeric, garlic, ginger and <br>
        tamarind paste until smooth, using either a food processor or pestle and mortar.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Cut the pollock fillets into halves (or chunky pieces if really large), <br>then season well with salt and pepper.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Heat the oil to medium/high in a deep frying pan, add the onion and <br> fry for about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Then add the split chillies, <br> curry paste, the other 1/2 of the ground coriander and a little more oil if <br> necessary, slowly stirring everything together.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Mix in the tomato and fry for 1 minute, then add the coconut milk and <br> season with more salt and pepper before reducing the heat.
        <br><br>
        5. Add the fish to the pan, cover and simmer gently over a medium heat <br> for about 5-6 minutes, turning the fish over half-way through. Add the <br> fresh coriander and season again with salt and pepper. <br><br>
        6. Serve in bowls with boiled rice and naan bread as sides.
